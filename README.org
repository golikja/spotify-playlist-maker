* Introduction

I was browsing my Spotify account and looking through a few of the
artists that I follow. They have a good interface for seeing more
articles like the ones you already like. However, as far as actions
go, they dont' make it easy to go ahead and listen to a sampling of
each of those artists. Instead, they just let you go to each related
artist's profile.

What I would like is just a simple way to:

** Pick an artist

Just pick on (either freeform or else pick from your list of followed artists)

** Queue up or create a new playlist based of that the *seed artist's* related artists top songs
