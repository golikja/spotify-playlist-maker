* Introduction
I was browsing my Spotify account and looking through a few of the
artists that I follow. They have a good interface for seeing more
articles like the ones you already like. However, as far as actions
go, they dont' make it easy to go ahead and listen to a sampling of
each of those artists. Instead, they just let you go to each related
artist's profile. Granted, this isn't a [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19781876/spotify-api-create-temp-playlist-not-loading][novel idea]], but I still
thought it was worthwhile to tackle.
