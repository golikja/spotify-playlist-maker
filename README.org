* Introduction
I was browsing my Spotify account and looking through a few of the
artists that I follow. They have a good interface for seeing more
articles like the ones you already like. However, as far as actions
go, they dont' make it easy to go ahead and listen to a sampling of
each of those artists. Instead, they just let you go to each related
artist's profile. Granted, this isn't a [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19781876/spotify-api-create-temp-playlist-not-loading][novel idea]], but I still
thought it was worthwhile to tackle.

* Setting up
To run locally, you'll need to create a new [[https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/][Spotify application]] to
authenticate your users (and access their resources). This application
expects the following as environment resources:

SPOTIFY_APP_ID

SPOTIFY_APP_SECRET

SPOTIFY_KEY

* Deploying
To deploy, clone to Heroku and set the appropriate environment
variables.
